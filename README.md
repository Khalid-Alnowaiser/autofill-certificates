Looking to automate the process of filling in certificate information? Look no further! Here's a handy Google Apps Script that allows you to automatically populate static certificate designs with recipient data. Here's how it works:

Create a new Google Slide file.
Set the certificate design as the background.
Add a textbox where you want the data to appear and use placeholder text like "name" or "date."
Prepare a Google Spreadsheet with the list of names and other info you want to fill in.
Create a Google Drive folder to save the generated certificates.

Now, let's run the script in two sections:

Section 1: It automatically duplicates the Google Slide and replaces the placeholder text with data from the spreadsheet.

Once Section 1 completes, move on to Section 2:

Section 2: It generates PDF copies of the Google Slide files.

Remember, if you're dealing with large amounts of data, you can break it down into multiple runs by adjusting the loop values. For example, start with "for(int i = 0; i<20; i++)" and then rerun with "for(int i = 20; i<40; i++)" and so on.

Keep in mind that the first section can be slow, so it's best to run the two sections as separate processes.
Note: Feel free to customize the script to suit your specific needs and preferences.
